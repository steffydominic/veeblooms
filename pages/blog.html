            <li>Firstly, botanists categorize the Rosary Pea as a legume.</li>
             <li>This occurs because this perennial plant develops in the form of a slender, climbing vine. In addition, the species frequently twists its way around trees, hedges, and shrubs. Secondly, its leaves develop as quite slender, and roughly 5 in (12.7 cm) long.</li>
              <li>Further, the thin branches develop as herbaceous in nature. The flowers remain small and show either white, violet, or pink, and typically grow densely clustered.</li>
               <li>Thirdly, the deadly seeds of the fascinating plant develop within small pods. These average roughly 2 in (5.1 cm) in length. Each pod contains 3-8 of the seeds, and thankfully, the shell of each produces a relatively thick and hard covering.</li>
                <li>Finally, the seeds of the Rosary Pea themselves appear in different color varieties. However, the red color with a black spot remains the most common of the combinations. Nevertheless, white, green, and black seeds occur as well. </li>

               <h3>How to care Rosery Pea Plant</h3>
                    <ul>


                       
                           <li> Choose the planting site for your climber carefully: its long flexible stems may need some shelter, but planting right next to a wall might keep it from the sun or water it needs.</li>
                           <li> Make sure that there's room for the climber to grow when it gets tall, and remember that it will grow towards the sun unless carefully trained. </li> 
                           <li> Be sure you will be able to manage the plant once it becomes tall, or that if it has a mind of its own, it won't become a problem.</li>
                           <li> a support structure before you plant your climber. Common support structures are trellises, wires, strings, or existing structures.</li> 
                           <li> Some plants, like ivy, climb by aerial roots and need no support.</li> 
                           <li> Aerial rooted climbers are fine for concrete and masonary, but should never be allowed to climb on wood. </li>
                           <li> Clematis climbs by leaf stalks and the Passion flower by coiling tendrils.</li>
                           <li> Akebia and Wisteria climb by twining stems in a spiral fashion around its support.</li>
                           <li> Do not use permanent ties; the plant will quickly outgrow them. </li>
                           <li> Use soft, flexible ties (twist-ties work well), or even strips of pantyhose, and check them every few months.</li>
                           <li> Make sure that your support structure is strong, rust-proof, and will last the life of the plant.</li>
                           <li> Anchor your support structure before you plant your climber.</li>
                           <li> Dig a hole large enough for the root ball. Plant the climber at the same level it was in the container.</li>
                           <li> Plant a little deeper for clematis or for grafted plants. </li> 
                           <li> Fill the hole with soil, firming as you, and water well. As soon as the stems are long enough to reach their support structure, gently and loosely tie them as necessary.</li>
                           <li> If planting in a container, follow the same guidelines. Plan ahead by adding a trellis to the pot, especially if the container will not be positioned where a support for the vine is not readily available. </li>
                           <li> It is possible for vines and climbers to ramble on the ground or cascade over walls too. Clematis and Roses actually work quite well this way.</li>
